European Water Framework Directive.

Introduction
The European Water Framework Directive1 (WFD) aims to protect and improve the
ecological status of aquatic systems in order to promote sustainable watershed use and ensure an
adequate water supply. In all cases, Member States must reduce the use of hazardous substances
and ensure that water pricing encourages conservation. Each Member State must define water
quality objectives for every water body (river or consistent hydrogeological unit) within its
jurisdiction, conduct a watershed assessment, and prescribe appropriate restoration measures
within a given timeline. Member states and the Commission agreed upon a common
implementation strategy, with a EU team of national experts working together in order to ensure
harmonization across national assessment methods of water ecological quality. This process is
known as the intercalibration exercise and is less than half completed (Birk et al., 2013).
The assessment of the ecological status of a water body is a relatively new and innovative
policy for water quality management; earlier directives merely imposed standards for water
chemistry and only targeted the waters used for specific purposes. The integration of biological
criteria with water quality standards raises questions about how to quantify and assess
biodiversity in aquatic ecosystems and how to address changes in those systems over time.
In this paper2, we combine perspectives from sociology and ecology to examine the
concepts and tools associated with the WFD and identify challenges to implementing the WFD
in the context of global climate change. We are particularly interested in the evolution of
technical terms used by the scientific community over the last 20 years of WFD discussion and
implementation to describe the concepts of reference conditions and the precautionary principle,
from the production of the first version of the WFD in 1994 through the end of the European bioindicator intercalibration in April, 2012. We argue that such concepts used in the WFD are
hardly grounded in current ecological theories and are difficult to apply in a context of changing
environment and long-term interactions between man and nature. But they corresponded to
specific needs from different institutions and stakeholders which promoted them. By integrating
insights from multiple disciplines, we can identify the practical advances made possible by the
WFD and build a foundation for developing management guidelines in the future.
We mainly focus on the use of reference condition in relation with biological indicators
because the ecological assessment of water bodies, in comparison with the chemical assessment,
is one of the most innovative characteristic of the WFD.
1. Reference conditions: a historically situated policy concept
The Water Framework Directive provides a specific framework for evaluating water
policies: 1) water quality objectives must be set in relation to reference conditions; 2) actions to

The Water Framework Directive (2000/60/EC) was adopted on October 23, 2000 by the European Parliament and
the Council. It established "a framework for community action in the field of water" (L 327, 22/12/2000, p. 0001 0073).

achieve the objectives must be compared in terms of cost and efficiency; and, 3) water quality
data must be systematically collected and made public. Through this process, the European WFD
regulations aim to make water-related policies more accountable, particularly to funders, in the
form of quantitative indicators. The concept of reference conditions had never been used before
the WFD in European water policy. We argue that it is a historically situated concept which
corresponds to specific needs of the actors who promoted the WFD. The “driving-forces,
pressures, state, impact, response” conceptual model that also imbues the WFD has older roots,
but it similarly met some of the needs of the WFD writers.
This concept filled a policy loophole, i.e. the lack of standard for natural waters. The
European water quality policy first developed with a command and control approach regulating
specific pollutants. This approach, often referred as the classic “community method” (Scott and
Trubek, 2002), prevailed in European environmental policy until the late 1990s. It imposed strict
legally-binding standards based on chemistry whose enforcement was deemed easy to verify
(Homeyer, 2004). A first wave of directives (1973-1988) produced a “kaleidoscope” of sector
regulation (Aubin and Varone, 2004; Santbergen, 2013). Since the early 1980s, highly regulated
Member States have further pushed for regulating all surface waters with strict rules complying
with their domestic legislation in order to protect their industry, to avoid administrative cost of
adaptation, and to value their first-mover advantage. In the aftermath of Seveso and Sandoz
accidents, these “leaders” found political support in environmental NGOs and the European
Commission (EC) (Dezalay, 2007) while their opponents remained isolated in the Council of
Ministers or in the Parliament (Héritier, 1995; Sbragia, 1996). The scope of the second wave of
directives (1988-1991) regulated waste waters and natural waters affected by eutrophication.
However, Member States could restrict the implementation of these directives to specific zones.
In 1994, many natural waters remained out of the scope of European law.
Michelle Cini (1995) studied how employees of the Directorate-General for the
environment (DG Environment) of the EC promoted the precautionary principle. She noticed
that they developed a specific political discourse of ecological modernization which reconciles
economic growth -a dominant motto in other DG- with environmental conservation in a specific
manner. It consists in arguing that some elements of the environment are vital for human survival
and must be protected at all costs by precaution, while the protection of others may be subjected
to cost-benefit analyses. The WFD is influenced by this discourse. It prohibits the use of
hazardous substances. It holds that the good ecological status must be achieved whatever the
cost, except for the water bodies that are highly modified by profitable activities.
In drafting the ecological quality of water directive (EQW), EC policy-makers targeted
uniform and legally-binding European water quality standards. For chemical parameters, they set
a baseline of zero contamination, which was the OSPAR3 environmental quality goal for the
marine environment (Howarth, 2006). A similar uniform baseline in ecology was yet lacking.
The EQW draft (Commission of the European communities, 1994) did not set ecological
requirements in quantitative terms. It integrated aesthetic and natural heritage considerations into
restoration objectives. The focus was primarily on water quality and secondarily on biological
connectivity in river systems. The term "reference conditions" was not used. The text prescribed
high ecological water quality and sediment quality as meeting the needs of the ecosystem,
especially the capacity for “self-purification”, high level of biological diversity (aquatic plants,
invertebrates, fish, amphibians, mammals and birds), and the absence of toxics and diseases
linked to human activities. The objectives were articulated in terms of hydrosystem functions and

services, rather than descriptors of biological communities. Each Member State was responsible
for developing its own definition of “good conditions” and for implementing restoration
measures.
In the following years, despite Council rejection of the text, policy-makers in DG
Environment went on looking for more quantitative binding ecological standards and selected a
small group of scientists willing to proceed in this direction (Loupsans and Gramaglia, 2011).
The outcome of this process is Annex V of the WFD. Reference conditions can therefore be
understood as a political concept EC policy-makers needed to anchor a uniform norm-setting for
all European surface waters to ecology. However, the adoption of the concept in the WFD did
not follow a linear path.
In 1995, the Dutch, French and British governments challenged the EQW directive and the
classic community method for water policy all together. They released several position papers
pointing the lack of coherence among existing EU water policy. They managed to convince the
EC to adopt an integrated strategy, that would give Member States more flexibility in setting
environmental standards and optimizing ways of goal attainment (Dezalay, 2007; Santbergen,
2013:115-6). The drafting of the WFD followed. In 1998 and 1999, the Council tried to get rid of
legally-binding ecological objectives but the Parliament reintroduced them during the codecision
procedure (Kaika and Page, 2003). The Council eventually accepted this clause because the
WFD included intrinsic exemptions (Article 4) offering ample provisions for local adaptation to
regional conditions and economic considerations. The resulting ambition of the WFD is highly
ambiguous, leaving many choices and interpretations open for the implementation phase (Barone
and Bouleau, 2011; Hering et al., 2010; Junier et al., 2011; Keessen et al., 2010; Santbergen,
2013).
While the ecological content of the WFD (Annex V) is still framed according the
community method, the rest of the WFD instead corresponds to a new governance model (Scott
and Trubek, 2002), with a focus on implementation procedures, such as consultation
requirements, transparency concerns, and reporting obligations. Santbergen (2013) argues that
this part of the WFD shows a strong influence of the British philosophy for managing the
environment at the most cost-effective way (Dezalay, 2007; Knill and Liefferink, 2007). Indeed,
the WFD holds that Member states shall “make judgments about the most cost-effective
combination of measures” (Annex III). Comparing the cost-effectiveness of different measures
requires a common “reference”, which does not need to be a uniform ecological baseline
throughout Europe. However the concept of reference conditions could do the job in combination
with a general framework for comparing options of restoration. In the environmental field, the
OECD developed such a conceptual framework (pressure, state, response) in 1993 to compare
management actions (responses) that aim to reduce impacting activities (pressures) to achieve a
desired state (OECD, 1993, 1994). This framework was subsequently amended (driving forces,
pressure, state, impact, response or DPSIR) by the European Environment Agency and used to
assess the state of European water bodies and the effectiveness of water quality policies (EEA,
1995). The DPSIR model is a method for cost-benefit analysis based on mitigation logic
(Fernandez et al., 2014). The model aims to compensate for pressure from socioeconomic forces
by using political and economic responses to influence human activities and prevent
environmental degradation. Pressures and responses are made commensurable by selecting
appropriate indicators. The logic of this model underlies the entire WFD, as evidenced by the
high occurrence of the terms "impact" (67) "pressures” (26), “status” (242) and “measures” (126)

in this context in the English version4. Apart from a few restrictions (see Part 4), the directive
requires programs of measures (Art 11 of the WFD) to mitigate for "inevitable" pressures (see
Figure 1). This model of compensation hinges on the target of the good state for each body of
water, which is defined by a non-significant deviation to a reference value on the scale, and
which is achieved through restoration actions.
Last but not least, the concept of reference conditions helps coordinating the work of
expert committees towards a unified monitoring network. This issue was addressed in the
intercalibration exercise which “yielded a fundamental and unified vision of what constitutes
good ecology across Europe” (Birk et al., 2013). It is based on a “significant level of statistical
abstraction” (ibid. :490) which contrasts with compliance indicators used in the classic
community method that were easy to verify. Intercomparability (of waterbodies) and
intercalibration (of indicators) raised technical stakes hardly accessible to the general public.
Only experts commissioned by Member States may learn from each other through this process.
This relates to the open method of coordination (Kraemer et al., 2004 ; Radaelli, 2003) inscribed
in the Lisbon Strategy, which seeks Member States convergence through benchmarking rather
than compliance to binding standards.

The word ‘status’ is used in the WFD to refer to the environmental conditions of a water body, and the word
‘measures’ refers to actions by States to restore the desired environmental conditions, i.e. the environmental state
and the responses in DPSIR language.

The socio-historical background on environmental public policy given above allows us to
understand the inclusion of the reference conditions concept in the WFD as a flexible concept
that was compatible with three different philosophies: setting legally-binding standards,
assessing the cost-effectiveness of measures, and coordinating the implementation of Member
States with common benchmarks. . In Europe, the conceptual framework of the WFD was met
with enthusiasm by several national organizations, which are responsible for the management of
aquatic ecosystems, including river basin authorities and environmental agencies. Members of
these organizations have long sought an economic argument to justify the protection of the
environment and help establish priorities. However, the conceptual design of the WFD probably
would not have withstood criticism from skeptics (Moss, 2008)had it not also received input
from other experts in building its quantitative methodological framework (scale of measurement,
benchmarks and set of metrics).
2. Implementing the reference conditions as an operative concept in the WFD
The WFD defines the reference conditions for an ecological system as the conditions that
prevail in the absence or near absence of human disturbance5. This corresponds to hydromorphological, physico-chemical and biological characteristics of "undisturbed," pollutant
concentrations close to zero, and synthetic and non-synthetic pollutants at levels below
"background noise." To assess ecological characteristics, a regionalized aquatic typology is used
that accounts for variation in biodiversity due to ecoregional characteristics (hydro-climatic,
physical habitat and biotic trophic factors) in water bodies of a similar size (Hughes and Larsen,
1988; Omernik, 1987). A ‘good condition’ refers to any size of deviation from the reference
typology that does not lead to significant changes in biological communities. A more significant
deviation is interpreted as a sign of disruption of the key factors that determine local biodiversity.
This approach assumes a possible return to a ‘good condition’ if the cause of disturbance is
suppressed, provided the disturbance has not caused irreversible harm.
This definition of an ecologically ‘good condition’ is similar to that used in the United
States in the Clean Water Act of 1972 (U.S. House of Representatives, 1972). It refers to the
"natural" character of the ecosystem (its structure and function) and is directly linked to the
concept of biotic integrity (Karr, 1981). Recently, this concept and the criteria for evaluating a
deviation from reference conditions have been codified in the United States (Davies and Jackson,
2006) and Australia (Water Reform Framework in Stoddard et al., 2006) . The description of the
reference condition is based on knowledge of sites with desired characteristics. This can include
knowledge of "pristine” (that is to say, “untouched”) sites, but may also include historical
knowledge, or even expert opinions or the results of simple modeling techniques.
The concept of reference conditions has been used for many years in other fields like forest
ecology and paleolimnology, (Swetnam et al., 1999). Interdisciplinary approaches are used to
describe changes in ecosystems and/or landscapes over the long term (up to millennia). Such
reconstructions have driven the evolution of a new academic field, "applied historical ecology,"
which explicitly uses the concept of reference conditions to guide restoration actions and the
management of natural systems (Egan and Howell, 2001). In forest ecology, historical reference
conditions are viewed as reflecting the long term variability of the structure, composition and
process of ecosystems over time (Fulé et al., 1997), providing insights to natural disturbance
5

The terms ‘disturbed,’ ‘undisturbed’ or ‘disturbances’ are used a total of 107 times in Annex V of the WFD,
without being clearly defined.

regimes (Kaufmann et al., 1998). Reference conditions are reconstructed from multiple sources
depending of the spatial and temporal scale considered (documentary archives,
dendrochronology, palynology, remote sensing…).
In comparison, Annex V of the WFD relies upon an assessment of the deviation from a
state of stable reference conditions6, which are defined using criteria related to species
abundance and taxa richness associated with regional environments. In the WFD, the biological
indicators are restricted to aquatic environments. Hydro-morphological alterations are more
taken into account in the WFD than in the EQW directive. As a result, the WFD definition of
environmental objectives is imbued with what Steyaert and Ollivier (2007) named a
“communitarian perspective” on environmental objectives, which excludes “human activities to
build up the reference conditions of water” and gives “advantage to the pristine model of nature”.
This model is consistent with the concept of reference conditions. Considerations for humans are
not to be found in the ecological part of the directive but in the economic part, which in contrast
is inspired by a “utilitarian perspective” (ibid.;Bouleau, 2008). In contrast with the EQW
directive the WFD abandons natural heritage and aesthetic considerations and does not consider
any more the terrestrial part of the fluvial corridor (riparian zone, bird, amphibians and
mammals). The division of labor between ecology, which is responsible for determining
environmental standards, and economics, which is responsible for optimizing regulations by
determining prices once standards are set, corresponds to the neoclassical school of
environmental economics (Anderson and Leal, 1991).
Developing ecological standards raises the question of their social legitimacy. Why would
some ecotypes, species or functions be preserved and not others? Historically, ecological
indicators were constructed to quantify problems that were of public concern at specific scales
and over certain time periods (Bouleau et al., 2009; Turnhout, 2009). These indicators would not
necessarily be appropriate at other spatial-temporal scales. The definition of “good” in the WFD
aimed to standardize the various national methods of assessment and make a “good condition” in
hydrosystems comparable across all Member States (i.e., the European intercalibration process).
In practice, the implementation of these principles has been extremely variable from State to
State based on the availability of data and resources, the bio-indicators and types of water bodies
considered, and even the pre-existing schools of thought among freshwater biologists and
managers.
“Reference conditions” are alternatively defined by Stoddard, et al. (2006) as:
- The biotic integrity or "natural" state for which long-term variability is acceptable within
relatively narrow limits (steady state).
- A state corresponding to conditions encountered in minimally disturbed areas. Here we accept
minimum disturbance over large areas.
- A condition or state that existed prior to any human modification considered "important" by the
authors. For example, Wallin et al. (2003) consider the period prior to the development of
intensive agriculture and/or industrialization (circa 1850 in England and 1750 in Germany) to be
the reference condition, regardless of previous human impacts7.

6

The drafters of the WFD were aware that there would eventually be changes (spontaneous or anthropogenic) in
ecological status (see infra note 8). In their minds, however, these changes would occur slowly over time and would
not call into question the purpose of restoration.
7
These approaches do not take into account the effects of shifting cultivation or medieval land clearing on
hydrosystems.

- The least disturbed condition in a given area. Criteria (water quality, development, land use,
etc.) are defined and used to select sites.
- The best state potentially achievable. This is the state that one can expect to achieve at a
relatively degraded site if one applies all possible management measures in terms of ecological
restoration (for example, in the Netherlands).
This diversity of approaches reflects the contrasting views among the ecologists and
scientists who were involved in the translation of the WFD into operational terms. The most
common existing approach is the selection of conditions that are minimally disturbed or
undisturbed based on certain anthropogenic pressures. Germany and Austria more strictly refer
to the concept of biotic integrity, combining historical and expert approaches (Schmutz et al.,
2000). The recent intercalibration exercise conducted in Central-Baltic region of Europe revealed
that the pressure criteria used to select reference sites needed further standardization (Pardo et
al., 2012).
It is interesting to note that this difficulty in calibrating definitions is not an isolated case in
European policy. Robert Salais, who is interested in the implementation of the Lisbon Strategy in
employment issues, pointed to the lack of a common definition of unemployed or employed
(Salais, 2004). Isabelle Bruno, who studied equal opportunity policies for men and women and
programs for financing pensions, also noted that common definitions were very blurred in those
policy fields (Bruno et al., 2006).
3. The ecological roots of the reference condition concept
The WFD appears to have been largely inspired by an old ecosystem paradigm that is based
on an a priori vision of nature centered around species (Clements, 1905; Elton, 1930; Tansley,
1935). Under this paradigm, each ecological unit is considered relatively constant in the face of
environmental variability and is able to regulate itself, much like an organism (the "balance of
nature" concept). Natural ecosystems move through a series of phases to reach a climax state,
where they remain until there are major changes in the global environment on a large temporal
scale. Ecosystems are predictable, although disturbance cycles are integral to the way they
behave (following disturbance, ecosystems return to their previous "optimal" state). Odum
(1953) and Whittaker (1975) popularized this concept and its associated holistic vision of
ecosystems. The concept of reference conditions is grounded in this idea of a stable state. But the
ecosystem paradigm described above has been challenged in recent decades on the grounds of i)
species dispersal and metapopulation theory (Hanski, 1999), and ii) the role of spatial
heterogeneity on ecological process and the importance of flux in landscape between ecosystems
(Pickett and Cadenasso, 1995). Ecosystems are now seen as unstable, open, hierarchical and
scaled (O'Neill, 2001). The most important for our discussion is to call into question the idea of
ecosystems as stable and predictable.
Initially, the concept of "resilience" accounted for variability in a system in a steady state by
explaining the variability as a response to small perturbations. The resilience concept addressed
variability in terms of return time to a stable state (Pimm, 1984) and suggested that there was a
maximum level of disturbance that could be tolerated without significant alteration of functions
(Holling, 1973). More recently, as a response to repeated failed restoration efforts that have
highlighted the irreversible nature of many of the changes sustained by natural systems, Scheffer
et al. (2001) proposed the concept of alternative stable states. Even in response to a continuous
gradient of environmental change (natural or human-induced), ecosystem change occurs
7

Author-produced version of the article produced in Environmental Science & Policy, 2015, 47, 32-41
The original publication is available at http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901114002044
doi:10.1016/j.envsci.2014.10.012

dramatically in a non-linear process from a given point. Ecosystems are not able to return to their
original state when previous environmental conditions are restored. Multiple different stable
states may persist in a single ecosystem. This theory identifies non-linear, and even “chaotic”
systems-theory-based pathways of ecosystem change. In particular, river landscapes experience a
complex entanglement of long-term and short term fluctuations which make idealistic to consider
reverting to any previous stage, pristine or not (Dufour and Piégay, 2009).
From a conceptual standpoint, climate change sheds light on the contradiction between the
reference conditions concept and the dynamic trajectories of aquatic ecosystems. The
consequences will be important for the distribution of many species, especially cold water
species. Accessibility to refuge areas during periods of stress (i.e., low flow and thermal peaks)
will become a major factor in maintaining these populations (Buisson and Grenouillet, 2009;
Pont et al., 2006). Climate change will not only change the ecological status of undisturbed
areas, but will also interact with the impacts of human activities on biological communities (e.g.,
eutrophication and the coupling of thermal regimes and hydrology) and will exacerbate the
uncertainties associated with the monitoring and assessment ((European communities, 2009). It
is likely that the so-called reference biological communities are evolving and simulation
exercises demonstrated the potential impact on the assessment of ecological status (Logez and
Pont, 2013).
Another major challenge to the concept of reference conditions stems from the observation
that significant environmental modifications by humans have occurred for several millennia. The
notion of an undisturbed state no longer has ecological significance. Expanding upon the original
concept of an ecosystem, the socio-systems concept (Fischer-Kowalski, 1997) recognizes the
inseparability of natural and social aspects of these systems and the central role of humanenvironment interactions. In the academic field of environmental history, and more specifically
history of ecology, there is an underlying premise that man and nature have co-evolved since
Neolithic times.Human activities are not always perceived as synonymous with destruction
(Balée, 1998). Rather, it is recognized that human activities could also create, through long-term
interactions with nature, cultural landscape having an higher value of biodiversity (Balée, 1998;
Farina, 2000).
The distinction between natural and human-altered states is misleading. It implies that one
can separate ecosystem characteristics that result directly from human actions from those which
are natural characteristics of a dynamic system. Identifying human-induced characteristics is
relatively possible at the local level, provided that managers allocate resources to making human
impacts publicly visible and measurable with ecological status indicators (Bouleau et al., 2009).
In contrast, for rivers that continuously experience flooding and chemical inputs from upstream,
the millennial transformation of watersheds by humans (including changes to forest cover) make
it impossible to define an ecosystem state that has not been impacted. A recent case study of the
Drôme River, southeast France, shows the temporal succession of interactions between land
drainage and river basin dynamics (Pont et al., 2009). Gunderson and Holling (2002) proposed
the concept of panarchy to account for the complex natural and human dynamics of watersheds.
In a related discussion, Lévêque et al. (2003) suggest the term anthroposystem. The dynamics of
ecological systems can no longer be explained using bio-physico-chemical rules alone, and the
distinction between natural and anthropogenic forces is artificial.
In a critical analysis of the WFD, Steyaert and Ollivier (2007) conclude that the ecologists
who participated in the writing of the text were overwhelmingly influenced by the concept of
ecosystem stability and focused on systematically considering human activities as disturbance

factors. Recently, Dufour and Piégay (Dufour and Piégay, 2009) proposed to replace the
restoration strategy aimed at achieving a defined, "natural," ideal ecological state (referencebased strategy, stemming from Leitbild (Kern, 1992a)) with a strategy that defines objectives
based on the services provided by ecosystems.
4. Towards biological indicators based on functional criteria
In parallel to the drafting of the WFD, a conference, which took place in Vienna in 1998,
focused on assessing the ecological integrity8 of rivers (Jungwirth et al., 2000)and developing
WFD-compliant biological assessment methods (Jungwirth et al., 2000). Most of the biological
indicators presented were based on a static description of aquatic communities (micro and macro
algae, invertebrates, fish) and by grouping water bodies into discrete categories (river zonation
system). As the reference condition concept, these biomonitoring tools rely mainly to the long
obsolete concept of climax (see before) and do not consider the modern idea of species turnover
and continua of community structure along environmental gradient (Friberg et al., 2011).
Aquatic ecologists have expressed many criticisms about the lack of functional criteria
used in such biological indicators (Friberg et al., 2011), both for conceptual reasons and because
of the current emphasis on expert opinion. However, in spite of awareness about the limitations
of the conceptual approach of the WFD, many European scientists paint a more positive picture
of the first ten years of implementation of the directive (Hering et al., 2010). One main reason is
that the implementation of the WFD has led to the establishment of networks of biological
monitoring that use more standardized sampling techniques. Although the requirements outlined
in the directive are based on a limited number of biological (and chemical) indicators, this has
the advantage of focusing members’ efforts on specific common protocols, thereby helping to
improve the methods. The need to standardize methods across European countries has led to
unprecedented development of international discussion and collaborative research projects,
including more than 1100 publications related to the WFD in 10 years (Web of Science, July
2009). Because the WFD approach was very pragmatic, it was possible to apply it in most
countries, despite its shortcomings. The implementation of the WFD has greatly improved the
degree of comparability of the ecological quality of rivers across Europe.
Moreover, it should also be noted that most of recent WFD-compatible bioindicators are no
more based on floro-faunal lists, but on functional criteria determined by ecological and/or
biological characteristics. This is particularly the case in France for fish (Oberdorff et al., 2002)
and invertebrates (Mondy et al., 2012). For example, a high level of omnivory is indicative of
degradation, while specialization in breeding habitats indicates a low degree of physical
alteration of the environment. The first advantage of these functional-type’s indicator is that, by
removing the taxonomic specificity, they can be used on a much wider geographic scale (i.e. the
European scale) which solve the problem of intercalibrating the different national methods. The
development of a paneuropean fish index (Pont et al., 2006) demonstrated its feasibility even if
the counterpart is a relative lack of sensitivity to some specific local situations. The second

The concept of biotic integrity is of American origin and was popularized in Europe in the late 1980’s in Germany
and Austria. It is based on a vision or Leitbild for a specific river reach, primarily defined by reference to the florofaunal structures pre-dating industrialization. (Kern, K., 1992b. Rehabilitation of streams in South-western
Germany, In: Boon, P., Calow, P., Petts, G. (Eds.), River Conservation and Management. John Wiley & Sons,

advantage is that the relation between stressor and response can be predicted based on clear
mechanisms of cause-effect. Nevertheless, in the case of these functional-type bioindicators, the
functions are only considered indirectly via the definition of functional specific guilds and
bioindicators purely based on functional descriptors of ecosystem remain to be developed in the
future.
Another major improvement is to not use any more typologies and pre-defined community
types but to consider more realistic gradient-based measure of community change. The
RIVPACS method was the first to attempt to predict, using site-specific variables, the expected
macroinvertebrate community in the absence of disturbance and to compare with the observed
one (Wright et al., 1993). Using both ecological-biological traits and modelling approach,
Oberdorff et al. (2002) and Pont et al. (2006) proposed multimetric predictive indexes to model
the functional characteristic of fish assemblages in the absence of disturbance and to assess the
ecological status of rivers.
In a recent work, Marzin et al. (2014) developed a new predictive multimetric index
considering the climatic conditions (air temperature and rainfall) prevailing during the ten years
before the assessment period and associating an uncertainty to the ecological assessment of each
site. In complement to establish long-term monitoring network, such tool could allow better
considering the changing nature of the environment.
Nevertheless, the capacity of biological indicators to identify the precise causes of
degradation remains questionable. The authors of the WFD assumed a direct relationship
between a pressure and a set of indicators, which has been shown to be false for several reasons.
They overestimated the capacity of biotic indicators to respond to different pressures in specific
ways. Except for few cases, such as the response of phytoplankton to increased phosphorus
levels, indicators generally respond to the different types of pressures (Marzin et al., 2012) like
water quality degradation and hydromorphological alteration. The results of the European
intercalibration process showed that there were significant relationships between the sensitive
bio-indicators and the main types of pressure, but these relationships were not as strong as
national experts had previously suggested (Pont, 2011). This result is also due partly to the large
uncertainties associated with the assessments (Clarke and Hering, 2006; Marzin et al., 2014).
And finally, most of rivers are affected by multiple pressures involving both the degradation of
water quality and changes in stream morphology and hydrology (Ormerod et al., 2010).
Summary and conclusions
The ambition to monitor the ecological conditions of all surface waters, rather than simply
considering the physico-chemical qualities of some waterbodies, represents real progress from an
environmental point of view. Nonetheless, the approach used by the WFD poses serious
problems. Some of the problems are relatively new, and some have not yet been overcome, even
fourteen years after the publication and implementation of the WFD.
The WFD is an ambiguous piece of law which includes legally-binding provisions in line
with the classic community method and a much more flexible framework for comparing and
assessing policy options based on economic criteria in line with new form of environmental
governance. Both policy models require defining quantitative indicators. Yet the drive for
establishing reference conditions relates to the legally-binding character of the WFD objectives.
From the ecological point of view, the idea of stable reference conditions refers mainly to the
concept of ecosystems reaching a "climax" state. It contradicts all the modern concepts in

ecology, underestimates the continuously evolving nature of our environment and does not
consider the long term interactions between man and nature. It should be noted, however, that the
relative stability of an ecosystem over a discrete time period is often a useful reference for
detecting and measuring a local change.
Conceptual debates about reference conditions do not prevent its implementation.
Approaches to "identifying" reference conditions are usually pragmatic. Reference conditions are
typically identified by examining relatively undisturbed sites based on a review of human
pressures, without actually seeking to define a common theoretical vision. This approach has
been applied in a variety of situations by adjusting the historical reference period, the frequency
of measurement, and the sampling locations to characterize a particular ecological impact that
posed a social problem. In practice, the new governance component of the WFD allowed experts
to define an evaluation framework, identify impacted sites, and prioritize restoration actions to
address those sites. The intercalibration process remains obscure for most lay people, but led
most Member States to a pragmatic approach. It consisted, at a minimum, to set common
reference conditions based on networks of undisturbed sites. In addition, the new generation of
bio-indicators based on “functional” characteristics of biological communities is better able to
provide a comparative analysis of water bodies at the European scale.
With regards to climate change and the assessment of ecological status, additional macroenvironmental variability resulting from climate change in the future will further challenge the
use of the concept of reference conditions. However, the limited duration of the WFD time frame
(2000-2027) could allow for revising local reference conditions to take into account new
information about regional environmental conditions (monitoring networks, modeled reference
conditions)9. In their management plans, Member States should at least assess the implications of
climate change in the context of other anthropogenic impacts, consider climate change in their
monitoring programs, and develop plans based on resilience strategies. The plans should favor
restoration projects that implement "no regrets" measures, i.e., measures that are sufficiently
reliable and robust to remain viable in a changing global context and that are not likely to
counteract measures taken by other parties to mitigate the impacts of climate change (e.g.
reestablishment of connectivity within river network in order to facilitate species migration,
riparian forest development).
But the reference conditions issue will resurface at the next stage of implementation of
the WFD as the primary objective of the management plans moves from assessment to
restoration (2015-2021 and 2021-2027). One of the guiding principles for restoration actions is
that the re-establishment of historical abiotic conditions and their associated disturbance regimes
will result in the recovery of biological communities prevailing before degradation. This
explicitly invokes the principle of community succession (and successional-based management
efforts). In reality, however, the results of restoration projects are often not what we expect, and
the system does not return to its previous state (Suding et al., 2004). This result can be explained
by the lack of existing systems that can be used to define reference conditions; changes in
conditions at large scales (landscape, watershed, and climate); an irreversible modification of
certain environmental parameters; changes in connectivity at the basin scale; changes in the
migration of species; and new biotic interactions and the alteration of biotic-abiotic feedbacks,

Annex V (1.3.1) states that Member States must establish monitoring programs to collect data that will be used to
evaluate changes in natural conditions over the long term.

which causes lasting changes in bio-geochemical conditions (Henri and Amoros, 1995; Nilsson
et al., 2007; Suding et al., 2004).
It is worth noting that the use of reference condition concept in WFD is more linked to
stability and reversibility than in the thoughts of forest ecologist in North America (Fulé et al.,
1997). Reversibility concept remains acceptable when considering local and short term
perturbations (e.g. recovery of a river from a local source of organic pollution), but is
questionable when i) numerous anthropogenic pressures are acting on the whole catchment and
ii) long term land use evolutions within a catchment have altered the large scale processes
controlling the fluvial dynamic (e.g. trying to revert a river stretch to a previous braided state
when the coarse sediment bed load is nowadays limited due to afforestation).
One possible future strategy for restoration could combine considerations for ecosystem
health, ecosystem services, and productivity in a sustainable manner for social benefit (Aronson
et al., 2006). Identifying society’s needs would require a more important participation of
managers, users and stakeholders at different levels (Dufour and Piégay, 2009). Historical
trajectories of systems remain an important point when targeting a better knowledge of the main
processes to be restored. Due to the complex dynamic of ecosystems, it is necessary to consider
ecological, social and economic values and the uncertainties about restoration objectives
(Hughes et al., 2005), Adaptive management, a problem-solving environmental management
approach (Aronson et al., 2006), appears as a promising way to handle restoration of European
water bodies in the context of the WFD. In all cases, historical trajectories of systems help
understanding the main processes to be restored. This knowledge is crucial when confronting
society’s demands and potential functioning. An interesting direction for future research would
be to see how different social groups implement the WFD and its tools (monitoring networks,
expertise, concepts, planning documents, and decision steps) for guiding future decisions about
the environment in a changing context.
